simple-1 --> smallenv that has a potatobox and 10 potato
simple-2 --> smallenv that has a carotbox and 10 carot
simple-3 --> same env, but has potato and carot

simpleEnv4 --> Randomize agent, potatoBox and carotBox Position

2. has 2 carot and 2 potato, only get reward if can get all (6M steps) (can collect but cant distinguis potato or carot)
3. has 2 carot and 2 potato, get reward each agent get point (6M steps) (scoreChange)
4. has 4 carot and 4 potato, and make later vegetable more valuable (6M steps)(vegetableScore)
5. has 1 carot and 1 potato, get reward in scoreChange and vegetableScore, add get time penalty (500K steps)
6. has 1 carot and 1 potato, get reward in scoreChange, add get time penalty (check vegetableScore is mather or not) (500K steps) 
7. has 1 carot and 1 potato, same as no. 5 but in (3M steps) --> stuck in localminima
8. has 1 carot and 1 potato, only get reward if can get all (6M steps) --> need more steps
8.1 retrain 6M Steps from no. 8 using the trained agent
8.2 retrain 6M Steps from no. 8 using the trained agent and add time penalty
8.3 retrain 10M Steps from no. 8
8.4 retrain 10M Steps from no. 8 and add time penalty

SimpleEnv4 --> only get reward if can get all, add litle penalty if vegetable type not match, the agent now can use powerup
